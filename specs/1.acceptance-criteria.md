# Acceptance Criteria (EARS format)

This document translates the functional requirements for the `naive_opt` library into the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.

## Core Search

- **AC1:** When a forward search is performed, **the system shall** return an `Option<usize>` containing the start byte index of the first match, or `None` if no match is found.
- **AC2:** When a reverse search is performed, **the system shall** return an `Option<usize>` containing the start byte index of the last match, or `None` if no match is found.
- **AC3:** When an existence check is performed, **the system shall** return `true` if a match is found, and `false` otherwise.

## Data Types

- **AC4:** Where the haystack is a `&str` or `String`, **the system shall** correctly perform all search operations.
- **AC5:** Where the haystack is a `&[u8]`, **the system shall** correctly perform all search operations.
- **AC6:** Where the API allows, **the system shall** accept `&str`, `String`, and `char` types as a needle.

## API and Iterators

- **AC7:** When a forward search iterator is used, **the system shall** yield all non-overlapping matches as `(usize, &slice)` tuples from start to end.
- **AC8:** When a reverse search iterator is used, **the system shall** yield all non-overlapping matches as `(usize, &slice)` tuples from end to start.
- **AC9:** Where the `Search` or `SearchBytes` traits are used, **the system shall** provide search methods directly on the haystack object.

## Case Insensitivity

- **AC10:** Where a case-insensitive search is performed, **the system shall** find matches while ignoring differences in ASCII case.
